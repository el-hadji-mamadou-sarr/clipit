## Next Features

- Create an APT package to simplify installation of the <strong>cl</strong> command
- Add a feature to "pin" a specific clipboard entry, allowing it to stay saved permanently in history.
- Set a configurable limit for how many clipboard entries are stored, so users can manage the size of their clipboard history.
- Search your clipboard history for specific text or keywords.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI): Develop a GUI version of the app to allow users to interact with their clipboard history in a more visual and intuitive way. This would include all the command line features.
